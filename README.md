Title: Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in
patients. By analyzing medical and lifestyle data, we will create a predictive tool that can assist
healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and preventive care. The project involves data collection,
cleaning, exploration, model building, evaluation, and reporting.

Objectives
1. Data Collection: Gather relevant medical and lifestyle data.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values,
outliers, and ensuring consistency.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to understand the distribution,
relationships, and key statistics.
4. Feature Engineering: Create new features that may help improve the prediction accuracy.
5. Model Building: Develop and train machine learning models to predict heart disease.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
7. Reporting: Compile findings into a comprehensive report with actionable insights.

Methodology
1. Data Collection:
o Source data from medical databases, electronic health records, or publicly available
datasets such as the UCI Heart Disease dataset.
o Key attributes to collect: Age, Gender, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol levels, Blood Sugar
levels, ECG results, Heart Rate, Exercise Induced Angina, Family History, Lifestyle factors
(e.g., smoking, physical activity).

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
o Handle missing values: Impute or remove missing data.
o Remove duplicates and outliers.
o Standardize categorical data and normalize numerical data.
o Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o Descriptive statistics: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation.
o Distribution analysis: Histograms, box plots.
o Correlation analysis: Heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.
o Group comparisons: Analyze heart disease incidence across different demographics and
medical histories.

4. Feature Engineering:
o Create new features from existing data (e.g., risk scores).
o Combine features to create interaction terms that might be significant.
o Use domain knowledge to create meaningful features that might impact heart disease
prediction.

5. Model Building:
o Split data into training and testing sets.
o Develop and train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
o Use cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness.

6. Model Evaluation:
o Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
o Compare models and select the best-performing one.
o Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

7. Reporting:
o Summarize findings in a detailed report.
o Include visualizations and statistical evidence.
o Provide actionable insights and recommendations for healthcare professionals.
